# C-Project-on-.Net_Framework
The Project is done by .Net-Frame_Work on C#. In this project, I have built an Varsity Portal System containing Student, Teachers and Administration user Portals. Where  both students and teachers will be able to become an user by registration and login to use the system's features. Administration will be able to edit both student and teacher info.
