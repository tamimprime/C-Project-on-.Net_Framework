# C-Project-on-.Net_Framework.
The Project is done by .Net-Frame_Work on C#.
In this project, I have built an Varsity Portal System containing Student, Teachers and Administration user Portals.
Where  both students and teachers will be able to become an user by registration and login to use the system's features.
Administration will be able to edit both student and teacher info.
However, Teachers will be able to edit Students info including deleting them as well as the Administrations.
The Students will only be able to view necessary info about themselves as well as their teachers concerning their respective cousrses and departments.
